        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Fast by Default</em> is a movement for software developers, architects,
          and teams who want to make speed an outcome of good engineering, not a
          late-stage optimization. It promotes the principles, patterns, and workflows
          that ensure performance is built into every layer of modern software development.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8">Core Principle</h2>
        <p>
          Performance isn't a single metric or tool result. It's the product of
          engineering discipline, smart architecture, and healthy team habits.
          When teams design for speed from the start, products become faster,
          more stable, and easier to maintain over time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8">Pillars</h2>
        <ol class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Understand what "fast" means for real users.</strong><br
            />Measure experience, not just load time. Use field data and metrics
            that reflect human perception.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Integrate performance into everyday development.</strong><br
            />
            Make it visible in tooling, code review, and CI so regressions never
            hide.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Architect for sustainable speed.</strong><br />
            Build systems, rendering strategies, and asset pipelines that stay fast
            as code and teams grow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use data to drive improvement.</strong><br />
            Observe real-world performance, diagnose slow paths, and fix bottlenecks
            with evidence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embed performance into culture.</strong><br />
            Treat speed as a shared responsibility and a marker of quality, not a
            specialist task.
          </li>
        </ol>
