          decisions in architecture, code, testing, deployment, and team habits.
          The goal is to build systems where speed and responsiveness emerge
          naturally from everyday work instead of being retrofitted in a rescue
          mission after users complain.

          Fast by Default is a model you apply every day, not a tool you
          install. When teams design for speed, verify continuously, and respond
          to real users, performance becomes the natural outcome of how you
          work.
