          Fast by Default is a software development approach where speed and responsiveness are built into a system from the beginning, rather than added in a rescue mission after users complain. It treats performance as a core requirement that guides architecture, code, testing, deployment, and team habits, so that fast behaviour is the natural result of everyday work.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-8">A system is Fast by Default when:</p>
        <ol class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            Architecture creates room for speed by avoiding designs that guarantee slow behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developers see performance impact during daily work, not weeks later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Budgets and checks run automatically, preventing regressions from reaching production.
          </li>
          <li>
            Real user data shapes decisions, and teams respond based on what users actually experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Speed is a shared responsibility, with engineers across roles protecting responsiveness for all users, devices, and regions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mt-8">
          Fast by Default is not a tool or framework. It is a disciplined way of building software that stays fast as it grows in features, traffic, and team size.
