          Fast by Default is a software development approach where speed and responsiveness are built into a system from the beginning, rather than added in a rescue mission after users complain. It treats performance as a core requirement that guides architecture, code, testing, deployment, and team habits, so that fast behaviour is the natural result of everyday work.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-8">A system is Fast by Default when:</p>
        <ol class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            Architecture creates room for speed by avoiding designs that guarantee slow behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developers see performance impact during daily work, not weeks later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Budgets and checks run automatically, preventing regressions from reaching production.
          </li>
          <li>
            Real user data shapes decisions, and teams respond based on what users actually experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Speed is a shared responsibility, with engineers across roles protecting responsiveness for all users, devices, and regions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mt-8">
          Fast by Default is not a tool or framework. It is a disciplined way of building software that stays fast as it grows in features, traffic, and team size.

        <h2 class="mt-12">The Seven Principles of Fast by Default</h2>

        <ol class="space-y-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Design for speed before you write code</strong><br />
            Make performance a requirement during planning and architecture. Avoid chains of work, slow dependencies, and designs that guarantee delays.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make performance visible during development</strong><br />
            Use tools and workflows that show how each change affects speed. Developers should see slow tasks, blocking operations, and heavy assets as they work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protect the experience with clear budgets</strong><br />
            Set limits for the things that slow users down. Enforce budgets for JavaScript size, API latency, startup cost, memory use, and render time. Let the tooling hold the line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimise complete user flows, not isolated screens</strong><br />
            Users experience journeys, not single pages or endpoints. Test and improve full flows, including the transitions, loading states, and interactions between steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use real-world data to guide decisions</strong><br />
            Base priorities on what users actually feel. Track key metrics in production, including Core Web Vitals, slow interactions, crashes, and long tasks on real devices and networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Treat performance as a shared responsibility</strong><br />
            Speed is a team outcome. Everyone plays a part, from backend and frontend to design, QA, and DevOps. Good performance habits must be part of everyday work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prevent decay through regular cleanup and review</strong><br />
            Performance declines naturally over time. Counter this by reviewing dependencies, removing dead code, resetting budgets, and auditing critical flows on a predictable cadence.
